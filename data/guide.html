                    <b>How to read the Data Log</b><br>
                    Example:<br>
                    <pre>08:48:37, U0605213, OB$3.78,          NB$3.28,     Cost$0.50,     B-W-A4,              languages (1).doc, pages 10      ($0.50)</pre>

                    Note: User might print more than 1 file in one go. Thus, there will be multiple entries in the data log. You would have to total up the cost for all the user's print jobs.
